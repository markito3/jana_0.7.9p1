As stated at the end of the below statement, this is not supported
and so is not integrated into the scons system. It remains here as
an example and in case someone should wish to try resurrecting it in
the future.

This directory contains source for a small utility that would create
Ntuples in an hbook file (for use with PAW) dynamically from JANA
objects via the toStrings method of factories. This is analogous to
the janaroot plugin only there were some issues with linking in the
cernlib libraries into the plugin on Mac OS X, hence this is a stand
alone utility.

Currently, this utility is not in good working condition. Because this
is a pure JANA program, the JApplication object is not specialized in
any way. This means factories have to be added through a plugin and if
those factories rely on any extra features of JApplication that a
sub-class provides, it will not work. For example, in the case of GlueX,
the DApplication derives from JApplication and provides a method
"GetBField()". The factories that need access to the B-filed will get
at it by dynamically casting the JApplication to a DApplication.

At this time I am suspending work on this until I can better justify it
or simply get the itch to complete it or find a work around.
