JANA Examples

The directories here contain some example programs using
JANA. These are not built by default. To build all examples,
invoke "scons -u install" from the examples directory (i.e.
the one containing this README file). To build only a specific
example program, cd to its source directory and do the same.

The example executables will be installed in the $JANA_HOME/example
directory.

For details on each example program, see the README file in 
its source directory.
