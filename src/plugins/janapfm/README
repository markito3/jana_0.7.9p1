This plugin is very specialized in its use and is therefore
not included in the standard build. It is not guaranteed to
compile and work for any platform since its use is so infrequent.

This plugin uses the perfmon package to access counters in the
performance monitoring unit (PMU) of the CPU. It was written
to do testing on a prototype 48-core machine. The version of
perfom installed was (I think), 4.0, but it was installed by a
sysadmin and I was never really sure where he got the code.
It may be this, but I'm not sure:
http://perfmon2.sourceforge.net/docs_v4.html

Permon is available on some Linux systems. This will likely not
work on most others or with other version of perfmon. It is,
however, a design that did work so could be customized to
other PMU APIs which is why it is here.

The PMU has a limited number of counters which seems to be much
smaller than the things they can be set to count (e.g. 4 counters
and >120 possible events). The plugin tries to get information 
on all possible events by changing which PMU events are being
counted on each JANA event. So the first JANA event will count
the first MAX_COUNTERS event types, the second JANA event will
count the next MAX_COUNTERS event types and so on, looping back
to the begining as needed.

The PMU events are written to the ascii file "janapfm.out" at
the end of event processing. Cumulative values over all JANA
events are written, but they are kept separate for processing
thread. No PMU events are recorded for the event reading thread 
or the main thread which tend to use very little of the CPU.
