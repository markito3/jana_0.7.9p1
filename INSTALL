Quick Start
--------------------
> tar xzvf jana_0.7.3.tgz
> cd jana_0.7.3
> setenv BMS_OSNAME `./SBMS/osrelease.pl`
> scons -j8 install


Obtaining the Source
--------------------
The source may be obtained as a tarball from the JANA website at:

http://www.jlab.org/JANA/downloads.php

The stable versions are numbered while the "jana_svn_daily_linux.tgz"
file is regenerated from the repository nightly and should be 
considered unstable.

Unpack the tarball containing the source. For example:

>tar xzf path-to-tarball/jana_0.7.3.tgz


Configuring
------------------------------------------------
Configuration is now done as part of the build phase
by scons. Optional package support is enabled in
most cases by setting the appropriate environment
variable. One variable you should set prior to 
running scons is the BMS_OSNAME environment variable.
This is used as the names of the build and install
directories so that JANA can be simultaneously built 
on multiple platforms using the same network-mounted
source directory. The script SBMS/osrelease.pl may be
helpful in setting this, but you are free to set it
to whatever you choose.

Here are the optional packages and their
associated environment variables.

xerces-c   XERCESCROOT
ROOT       ROOTSYS
CCDB       CCDB_HOME
curl       CURL_HOME

Some packages (e.g. xerces-c) may be installed in system
directories using the systems package manager. In this
case, you do not need to set XERCESCROOT and support
for it will be automatically included. This is not true
for most other packages.

The CURL package is not required to get CURL support. If the
environment variable is not set to point to the library,
then JANA is configured to issue shell commands to run an
external curl exectuable if needed. In that case though, you
must make sure that "curl" is in your PATH when the JANA 
program is run.

Also note that if CCDB is accessed through JANA, then the
JANA_CALIB_URL environment variable is used rather than
CCDB_CONNECTION. These have the same format and so can 
(and should) be set to the same value if you are using CCDB.



Building and Installing
---------------------------------------
To build JANA and install it, run "scons -jN install" where
"N" is the number of threads you wish to use to build. If
you only want to use 1 thread, you can leave out the -jN
argument altogether.


> scons -jN install

The binaries and headers will be installed in a directory 
parallel to src with the directory name of whatever the
BMS_OSNAME environment variable is set to. After installation
is complete, you should source the appropriate setenv script
to setup your environment to use JANA. 

> source /path/to/JANA/$BMS_OSNAME/setenv.csh

or

> . /path/to/JANA/$BMS_OSNAME/setenv.sh


Note that whenever you do an "scons install" it will overwrite
the setenv scripts using your current environment variables.


You can test that the build succeeded by running one of the utility
programs. For example, the "jana" utility:

> cd ./bin/jana --janaversion


A plugin for testing JANA with fake events is also included and
can be run like this:

> jana -PPLUGINS=TestSpeed

to run with 16 threads:

> jana -PPLUGINS=TestSpeed -PNTHREADS=16
